What is LocalMapia?
===================
LocalMapia is a web application that stores and provides a geographical location and location’s information via web interface. This web application should allow people to mark a location in the map to minimize complexity of finding geographical location’s information. Also, we would allow user to add more useful information about that location by themselves, under control of community moderators, to keep the freshness of the information on the website. We target the audience of this website to be in Thailand, especially in Bangkok from starts.

This project aims to be a thesis for our Bachelor degree of Computer Science in the year of 2009 at King Mongkut Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Thailand.
